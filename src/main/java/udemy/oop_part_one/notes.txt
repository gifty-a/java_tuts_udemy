The class fundamental component of OOP - A template/blueprint for creating objects
An object has state and behaviour - An object is an instance of a class
states in objects are stored as fields
Behaviour are methods exposing the fields
Access Modifier
Private - fields/methods with the private modifier can only be accessed from within the class
Public - fields/methods with the public modifier can be accessed by objects outside and within the class's package
Protected - when a field doesn't have an access modifier, this is the default modifier used. the field or method can only be accessed by other classes in the same package
Constructor helps you initialize items during object creation and initialize the object itself.
it's not advisable to call other methods, including setters in a constructor.
